### [Hello there](https://youtu.be/rEq1Z0bjdwc?si=b26k4plRfK_vvs_O) ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Aditya Bhalerao**, a software engineer with a focus on backend development and a curiosity for how things work under the hood

I mostly work with `Go`, `Python`, `Kubernetes`, and tools around `infrastructure` and `identity`. I like writing code that's simple, reliable, and well-reasoned

Currently, Iâ€™m working at [**Geminus Tech**](https://geminustech.com/) and [**Geminus Space**](https://geminus.space/)

Outside of work, I build small projects to explore ideas and learn by doing. Lately, I've been diving into `consensus algorithms` and `scalable access control`

I spend a lot of time studying system design, reading papers, exploring open source projects, and also contributing to a few. It's a big part of how I stay curious and grow
